- As a user, when the page loads I will see an image, any comments that image has, and the number of likes that image has.

- As a user, I can click to like an image, which will increase the number of likes that image has by one.

- As a user I can fill out an input fields and submit the form to add a comment to an image. I should see my new comment below any previous comments.

- As a user, when I refresh the page, any comments or likes I have added should be persisted to the backend API and I should see my changes on the page.
